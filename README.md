# eCH Specialist Group Political Affairs

This repository contains the documents and resources of the [eCH](https://ech.ch/) Specialist Group [Political Affairs](https://www.ech.ch/de/fachgruppen/politische-geschaefte) (Fachgruppe Politische Geschäfte / Groupe spécialisé affaires politiques).

## Subgroups

The Specialist Group is divided into subgroups. Each subgroup is responsible for a specific topic. The following subgroups exist:

- tutorial: A tutorial on how to use the the [LinkML](https://linkml.io/linkml/index.html) toolchain to create a data model for the eCH Specialist Group Political Affairs.

## Data-Centric Approach

The eCH Specialist Group Political Affairs uses a data-centric approach to develop its data schemata. This means that the **data schemata are the primary artifacts**. [LinkML](https://linkml.io/linkml/) is used to describe the data schema which in turn is also used to auto-generate parts of the documentation.

## Workflow

Manual steps:

- Description of the data schema in YAML using LinkML in the `input` folder of each subgroup in the file `schema.yaml`.
- Generate example data conforming to the schema in the file `data.yaml` in the `input` folder.
- Write the accompanying documentation in Markdown with files in the form of `1_head.md`, `2_intro.md` (`number_subject.md`) in the `input` folder.

Automated steps (every commit that changes files in the `input` folder triggers a GitHub Action that automatically):

- Generates the documentation using the `linkml-doc` tool. The generated documentation is stored as individual Markdown files in the `output/docs` folder.
- Creates a unified Markdown file from all the files in the `input` folder and stores it as `output/documentation_merged.md`.
- Converts the unified Markdown file from the `output` folder to DOCX using `pandoc` and a `template.docx` file in the `input` folder and stores it in the `output` folder.

### Include Autogenerated Documentation

To include the autogenerated documentation from `output/docs` into the final document, use the following syntax in the Markdown files in the `input` folder:

`{{include:path_to_md_file}}` e.g. `{{include:tutorial/output/docs/AgendaItem.md}}`

## Subgroup Folder Structure

Each subgroup has its own folder. The folder structure is as follows:

```
